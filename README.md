# work-scheduler

# description
- this is a work organizer that anyone could use to keep their day a little more organized and planned out. The hour blocks are programmed to be set a certain color when the hour has past or if the block is within the hour, or if the block is ahead of the current time. This makes it easier for someone to visually plan out their day.

# Usage
 -Enter in a task in the middle column, click the save button on the right side and your task will be added to the local storage.
 -Currently trying to figure out the code to make the input save on page after refresh.
